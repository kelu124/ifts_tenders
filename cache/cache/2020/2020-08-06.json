Care workers go into people\u2019s homes to help with the day to day aspects of living such as home help, personal care and companionship. Home care is flexible and can be anything from a couple of visits a week right through to 24/7 live in care.  Providers who provide the personal care element must be CQC registered.  Usually people who receive home care service are aged 65 and over.\nSupported Living is a service designed to help people with a wide range of support needs retain their independence by being supported in their own home. People in supported living are usually aged between 18-64 and may live with their family or have their own tenancy as part of a shared accommodation and are responsible for their own bills and cost of living. To afford these, the person may be entitled to a wide range of benefits and grants. In single person supported living, they will also have their own front door.\nAt present home care and supported living is commissioned on a spot (one-off purchase) basis where instead we want to move to partnership working with a framework or DPS of pre-qualified providers.\nThe future opportunity sets to procure both of these services in line with both procurement regulations and ensuring value for money.  We are issuing this Prior Information Notice to seek views of providers on the how these services could be structured in the future.
