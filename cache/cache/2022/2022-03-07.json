In the construction sector, with current methods and materials, offsetting carbon will be focal in meeting this requirement, rather than the sector becoming carbon neutral in its delivery. As most processes and methods in the construction industry are widely carbon rich, BHCC looks to work with suppliers on this carbon journey, with the aim and to encourage them to meet this aim in finding lesser carbon use methods and materials.  However, competition through a Framework is also a key element and will remain so, to ensure such new materials and methods are brought cost-effectively to Council Schemes through secondary competition.  Hence the proposed approach of 3 suppliers under a Framework Contract for Lot 1 on a 4+2+2 to award suppliers for investing and providing the support that BHCC needs and enable longer term relationships to deliver the outputs needed for BHCC to achieve its aim of being Carbon Neutral by 2030.", "initiationType": "tender", "tender": {"id": "BHCC - 033985", "legalBasis": {"id": "32014L0024", "scheme": "CELEX"}, "title": "BHCC JB Highways Services Contracts", "status": "active", "classification": {"scheme": "CPV", "id": "45233000", "description": "Construction, foundation and surface works for highways, roads"}, "mainProcurementCategory": "works", "description": "The Council is seeking professional, properly defined and priced propositions from suitably qualified and interested organisations for the provision of Highways Services.
